📘 ZoomTots – AI Educational Content Generation Platform

## Overview

ZoomTots is an experimental AI-assisted educational platform designed to make learning easier for primary school students.
The system converts uploaded presentation (PPT) study materials into simplified teaching videos where a virtual character explains the topic in a clear and engaging manner.

The goal of the project is to explore how artificial intelligence tools and automated processing can be used to transform static learning content into interactive teaching experiences.



## Problem Statement

Most students struggle to understand textbook explanations or presentation slides without a teacher’s guidance.
Especially for younger learners, PPT slides alone are not engaging and often difficult to follow.

Teachers are not always available for repeated explanations.
Therefore, there is a need for a system that can automatically interpret study material and present it in a simpler, teacher-like format.

ZoomTots attempts to solve this by automatically converting study slides into explainable video lessons.


## Key Features

• Upload study PPT files
• Extract text content from slides
• Simplify and structure explanations
• Generate narration audio
• Synchronize narration with slides
• Character-based teaching video generation
• Student login system
• MCQ evaluation after learning session



## System Workflow

1. User uploads a presentation file (PPT).
2. The system extracts slide text content.
3. Content is reorganized into explainable teaching steps.
4. Narration is generated using automated text-to-speech.
5. Slides and narration are synchronized.
6. An animated character presents the topic as a teacher.
7. Student watches the generated lesson.
8. An MCQ quiz evaluates understanding.



## Role of AI in the Project

This project was developed using AI as a development and reasoning assistant.

AI tools were used for:

* understanding complex implementation approaches
* designing the workflow architecture
* breaking the problem into modules
* debugging errors
* improving explanation structure
* refining feature implementation

The focus of the project is not training a new machine learning model, but using AI capabilities to build a practical learning solution and automate explanation generation.

This aligns with the idea of AI-assisted software development and rapid prototyping.



## Technologies Used

Frontend:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

Backend:

* Python

Libraries & Tools:

* Text extraction from PPT
* Text-to-Speech generation
* Video rendering (MoviePy)
* Firebase Authentication



## Educational Objective

ZoomTots explores how AI-assisted systems can:

* reduce dependency on constant teacher supervision
* help students learn at their own pace
* transform static study material into interactive content

The project demonstrates a prototype where AI helps convert content into understandable teaching rather than simply displaying information.



## Future Improvements

* Real LLM-based explanation generation
* Voice interaction with the teaching character
* Personalized teaching difficulty levels
* Question answering based on uploaded lesson
* Mobile application version
